# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Deep-Learning-and-Attention-Mechanisms
This project requires building a deep learning Seq2Seq time series model with attention to forecast complex, non-stationary data. Students must preprocess data, tune hyperparameters, compare against ARIMA/LSTM baselines, evaluate with metrics like RMSE/MAE, and analyze attention’s impact on accuracy.
